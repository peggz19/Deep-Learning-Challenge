## Analysis Overview

**Purporse** : The main goal of this analysis is to create and optimize a model capable of predicting which applicant, requesting a funding, has the most chances of success in their endeavours. That would help the Non Profit Funding Organization find the best applicants. Of course, throughtout that, we are mostly focused on the performance/accuracy of our model.
**Steps** : To start the process, we cleaned our data by dropping irrelevant columns and bining data containing outliers. Next, we assigned our features and target to two variables, x and y. From those variables, we split our data into train data and test data. The train data was to train our model and making it accurate while our test data was to actually see the performance of our model when given a new dataset. Our last step was to optimize the model to reach an accuracy of 75%.

## Results
Results: 
On the first try, our model gave an accuracy of 74.10% on train data and one of 72.05% on test data.
When starting the optimization process, the accurcay dropped to 69% on test data and it was possible to bring it up to 73%

## Data Preporcessing
Data Preprocessing
**What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?**
The target
**What variable(s) are the features for your model?**
**What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?**

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
