I had less parameters in my model summary and it means I have less features. Now I  don't know why. But I ended up with a better accuracy at the last epoch then what's on the starter_code.
I switched from ReLu to Tanh for my first hidden layers because it's a multidimensional graph and maybe not linear. But I noticed I had a better accuracy with ReLu
